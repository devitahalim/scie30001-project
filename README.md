# Investigating the Use of Mixture Models to Determine KIR Copy Number from DNA Sequence Data

This project investigates the use of mixture models to eliminate the manual thresholding step that exists in Pushing Immunogenetics to The Next Generation (PING) pipeline. Expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm was used to fit mixture model on the read ratio data and estimate the parameters of copy number groups, which were then used to determine thresholds between copy number groups. The algorithm developed in this project was able to successfully automate the thresholding step in PING pipeline and available for use.
